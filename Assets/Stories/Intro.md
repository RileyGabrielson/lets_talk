# Hello World

Hey there player.

So...

I had big dreams for this game.

I had *lots* of fun ideas.

I had *too many* fun ideas.

And I couldn't finish most of them.

Has that ever happened to you?

- [[Intro#I feel that way sometimes|Sometimes yeah]]
- [[Intro#Not Really|Not really]]

# I feel that way sometimes

`SET doesnt_like_me = 0`

We are in good company then :)

I'm sure you and I can figure it out.

[[Intro#Should we continue?]]

# Not Really

`SET doesnt_like_me = 1`

It happens to me a lot.

My mind spins and spins with ideas, and before I can even start on one I've had another idea.

Sometimes I can't sleep, cause my brain is so busy throwing out ideas.

The idea phase is really fun!

But crashing under the weight of the unfinished ideas isn't.

[[Intro#Should we continue?]]

# Should we continue?

If you'd like, we can make something together.

Something simple. But maybe something beautiful. At least to us.

What do you think?

`IF doesnt_like_me == 0`
- [[Intro#Let's do it!|Yeah let's do it]]

`IF doesnt_like_me == 1`
- [[Intro#Rejected|No thank you]]

# Let's do it!

Great!

`SET age = 18`

Thanks :)

Age: `$age`, for the win

`SET age = age + 4`

Age: `$age`, for the win

**This should be fun!**


# Rejected

No worries, I get it.

Before you go, I want to tell you something that I need to tell myself a lot.

You're doing a much better job than you think you are.

You're a **good** person. Seriously. You're not perfect, but right now *that is totally okay*.

Good luck, I hope you make something beautiful on your own :)
